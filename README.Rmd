[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chasemc/electricShine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chasemc/electricShine)

### Introduction
The purpose of this package is to make local shiny apps. It uses electron for creating the application and for repeatability it installs both R and R packages from a single MRAN date.

It currently only builds windows apps, but support is being aded for Mac and Linux as well.

Your shiny app should be built as an R package and should list all dependencies as an R package would. It should be put on GitHub and have its own repository.

A template for desgining a shiny app as a package may be found here: https://github.com/ThinkR-open/shinytemplate


### Example
```{r}

installTo <- tempdir()

MRANdate <- as.character(Sys.Date() - 3)

appName = "My_App"
description = "My demo application"
packageName = "demoApp"
semanticVersion = "1.0.0"
installTo = installTo
MRANdate = MRANdate
functionName = "run_app"
githubRepo = "chasemc/demoApp"
localPath  = NULL
only64 = TRUE



electricShine::buildElectricApp(
appName = "My_App",
description = "My demo application",
packageName = "demoApp",
semanticVersion = "1.0.0",
installTo = installTo,
MRANdate = MRANdate,
functionName = "run_app",
githubRepo = "chasemc/demoApp",
localPath  = NULL,
only64 = TRUE
)


# electricShine::electricShine() wraps the other functions and has three arguments:
# A path to a directory that does not contain a folder named "electricShine"
# The date from which to download R and R packages from MRAN
# Your github username and repository name in the format  "usernam/repo"  eg "tidyverse/ggplot2"


electricShine::buildElectricApp(name = "ExampleApp",
                            description = "My demo application",
                            productName = "productName",
                            version = "1.0.0",
                            installTo = installTo,
                            MRANdate = MRANdate,
                            functionName = "run_app",
                            githubRepo = "chasemc/IDBacApp", 
                            localPath  = NULL)
  
  
  
  
  
```
